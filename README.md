## Example promt for demo
1. Create a to-do app using Next.js, and Tailwind CSS with a single page named 'Dashboard' consume To-doWrapper component with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on to-do items with api created; include an input field and button for adding items, display items in a list format with options to edit, delete, and mark as completed using a checkbox; ensure real-time updates for adding, editing, and deleting items, and organize the code using functional components with comments for clarity. develop end to end app and wrapper component with entire app fully function

2. Create a social media app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, designed for personal use on a single page named 'Dashboard.' Implement a PostWrapper component with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts. Include an input field for adding a text message and a file upload button for adding an image to each post. Display posts in a feed format, showing text and images with options to edit, delete, and like posts. Implement real-time updates for adding, editing, and deleting posts. Organize the code using functional components with comments for clarity and build the app end-to-end, including the PostWrapper component, to ensure a fully functional personal social media dashboard.

3. Create a personal social media app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS on a single page named 'Dashboard.' Add a fixed, full-width header with a navigation bar styled using Tailwind CSS, including the app's title and an 'Add Post' button with rounded corners, hover effects, and shadow. Include a vertical sidebar on the left with profile details (profile picture, name, bio) and menu options for filtering posts, styled with background color, padding, and rounded corners. Display the posts in a card-style format with rounded corners and shadows. Each post card includes an image section, a text section, and icons for editing, deleting, and liking with hover effects.

Use Tailwind's utilities for a responsive layout, collapsing the sidebar into a dropdown menu on mobile views. Implement a PostWrapper component to handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts with real-time updates. Display posts dynamically in the card format, allowing interaction through Tailwind's transition effects. Include an optional comments section under each post.
